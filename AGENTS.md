# Kestra Mailchimp Plugin

## What

- Provides plugin components under `io.kestra.plugin.mailchimp`.
- Includes classes such as `Example`, `Trigger`.

## Why

- What user problem does this solve? Teams need a concrete starting point for building and validating new Kestra plugins without recreating the same project scaffolding from scratch.
- Why would a team adopt this plugin in a workflow? It gives plugin authors a ready-made reference repo they can adapt alongside their own build, test, and publishing workflow.
- What operational/business outcome does it enable? It shortens plugin delivery time, reduces setup mistakes, and makes internal or partner plugin development more repeatable.

## How

### Architecture

Single-module plugin. Source packages under `io.kestra.plugin`:

- `mailchimp`

Infrastructure dependencies (Docker Compose services):

- `app`

### Key Plugin Classes

- `io.kestra.plugin.mailchimp.Example`

### Project Structure

```
plugin-mailchimp/
├── src/main/java/io/kestra/plugin/mailchimp/
├── build.gradle
└── README.md
```

## Local rules

- Base the wording on the implemented packages and classes.
- Every input is a `Property<T>` rendered with `runContext.render`; secrets use `@PluginProperty(secret = true)` and `@ToString.Exclude`.
- No live credentials in tests or in the repo.
- Build with JDK 21 to 23 (Lombok does not support newer JDKs yet). Run `./gradlew build` before pushing: it also lints the plugin docs.
